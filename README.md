Welcome to learncloud.today. 

## Overview

This project is designed to allow everyone to learn about the various cloud services from Amazaon Web Services, Azure, & Google Cloud Platform and understanding the mapping of services across these 3 Cloud Service Providers (CSP). I chose to focus on these three as they currently make up nearly 70% of the market share for public CSPs. If you're interested some of the other major CSPs and the comparison of all services, check out [https://comparecloud.in/](https://comparecloud.in/). 

Over time the goal will be to create technical whitepapers on cloud concepts in addition to maintaining a mapping of cloud services across the in scope CSPs.

## Credit

This project and repo was inspired by [CloudComparer](https://github.com/ilyas-it83/CloudComparer). However, I felt to go a different path and and focus on AWS, Azure, & GCP for the time being. I have contributed several PRs to this repo and unfortunately somce of which were closed without merges. This led to creating my own comparision site for cloud services.
