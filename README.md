Welcome to learncloud.today. 

## Overview

This project is designed to allow everyone to learn about the various cloud services from Amazaon Web Services, Azure, & Google Cloud Platform.

Over time the goal will be to create technical whitepapers on cloud concepts.

## Credit

This project and repo was inspired by [CloudComparer](https://github.com/ilyas-it83/CloudComparer).
I prefer to stay focused on AWS, Azure, & GCP for the time being.
